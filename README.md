VISUAL REPRESENTATION OF ALGORITHMIC EFFECIENCY 
We have designed the program to determine the algorithmic efficiency of nearly any program by virtually represent it on graph.

We classify efficiency using two parameters:
1. Time 
2. Memory

Following functions that can be performed are:\
a. Analysis of time taken by single loop, block, or a whole program during execution\
b. Analysis of memory taken by loops ,blocks or a program during execution\
c. Comparing different programs to check which one is more efficient\
d. Real time plotting

It shows the average execution time taken by the programs by repeating it on different instances(avg time is shown by the dotted lines).

It shows the time taken by the blocks to execute.
Fact:  ∑(time taken by blocks to execute) = Avg. time taken by program to execute

It shows the memory occupied by a loop during execution.
Note: The memory taken by the loops can be zero too. Here we show the example to support our statement<br/><br/><br/><br/>

It shows the memory occupied by a single block during execution.
Fact: :  ∑(memory taken by blocks) = Memory taken by program <br/><br/><br/><br/>
